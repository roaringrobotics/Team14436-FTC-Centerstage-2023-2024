## NOTICE
USE THIS REPO AT YOUR OWN RISK! This is meant for FTC Team 14436 Roaring Robotic's robot: *Name to be determined*

We cannot guarantee that these files will work for you out of the box!


However, if you decide to run with this program, please download the release named "v1.0_Base" and physically copy over the gradle files and Android Manifest to the project you intend to use.
The reason for this is that without a direct connection to the official repo, there could be an issue with FTC imports that is extremely hard to fix on your own.
"v1.0_Base" contains all the gradle changes we have personally made with all of the implementations (except MeepMeep and Photon) we intend to use.
Some changes include changing to SDK 33, updating gradle to plugin version 8.1.3, adding roadrunner, openCV, FTCDashboard, enabling multiDex, and more!
So if you want gradle files that are already pre-configured, then go ahead and copy them over!

Please refer to the official repo to create your repo to transfer the gradle scripts over.
